 This  `x86-mingw32-build' script package was written for the MinGW Project
 by Keith Marshall <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>.

 The cross compiler build strategy has been derived from an earlier script,
 originally  written  by  Paul Millar <paulm@astro.gla.ac.uk>, and based on
 information provided by Pieter Thysebaert; this was subsequently  modified
 by  Heiko  Gerdau <hg@technosis.de>, and by Keith Marshall, and maintained
 by Michael Gerdau <mgd@technosis.de>.

 The modular structure, and the interactive features of the present  script
 have been adapted from the `portmaker' package, also written for the Mingw
 Project, by Earnie Boyd <earnie@users.sourceforge.net> and Keith Marshall.
